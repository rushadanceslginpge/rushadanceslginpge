Depending on your vehicle and your loan, you may need an extra-small or an extra-large loan. Maybe you want to shorten your loan term to pay it off sooner and save money on interest. On the other hand, maybe you want to lengthen your loan term to lower your monthly payment and take some stress out of your budget.

First Tech Federal Credit Union might be able to offer the perfect loan. Its minimum loan amount is just $1,000, lower than most lenders, so you can refinance even a small loan. And you can choose from a wide range of repayment terms, giving you a chance at a much shorter or much longer loan, depending on your needs.

First Tech’s rates aren’t terrible, but they’re higher than average among lenders we researched. The best rates only go to people with the best credit, so if that’s you it may make sense to look elsewhere. Still, if you’re looking for certain loan terms, it may be worth pre-qualifying to see what you’d get.
