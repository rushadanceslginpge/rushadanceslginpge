Getting a loan with poor credit can be difficult. Not only do you need to deal with worse rates and terms, but it’s hard to know which lenders are willing to work with you in the first place. But Ally will lend to borrowers with credit scores as low as 520, according to a media representative, so you may want to put it first on your list. Keep in mind that other factors aside from credit score are also involved in loan qualification.

Ally offers lease buyout loans and cash-out refinancing as well, if you need it. Cash-out refinancing allows you to borrow more than your current auto loan and receive the remainder in cash. This can be useful if you want to refinance and you also have some expenses that you would’ve otherwise used a personal loan for—but in this case, remember that the loan is secured by your vehicle.

You’ll need to borrow at least $7,500 for a refinance loan. That’s more than most lenders in our research, and it may be too much for some borrowers. The minimum repayment term is three years, which is also relatively high. But this isn’t a big problem because there’s no prepayment fee, so it won’t cost extra to pay off your loan early.
